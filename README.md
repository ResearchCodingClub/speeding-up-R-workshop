## Speeding up R

Slides and materials for the Research Coding Club talk given on 2023-06-28.

The slides are found in `slides.qmd` and can be rendered by opening in RStudio, or manually running `quarto::quarto_render('slides.qmd')`.

An example dataset containing Company House data of all companies incorporated in the UK since 1856 ([440MB archive download](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html), extracts to 2.4GB) is used in this presentation and should be downloaded and placed in this directory for the slides to be able to compile.

The quarto presentation is (nearly!) self-contained; compiling it will generate the slides with all the results and takes around 10 minutes on my laptop for the first time, although it uses a cache for subsequent builds.

The only exception is the benchmarking on the full dataset which was run independently to save memory.
These results can be generated by running the scripts found in `benchmarks/scripts` which will store the results in `benchmarks/results` ready to be imported into the presentation.
